This project was originally a plan to create the hardware I designed in a fake
hardware description language in a real one that can run on an FPGA since I had
one around for a Computer Architecture class project.

I no longer have an FPGA and I realized this was pretty impractical since
designing ram from logic gates to put on an FPGA is a pretty bad idea, they have
on board ram for a reason. Also I don't really need to ever design hardware so I
wasn't super into learning veralog.

This part will never be completed but I'll just go ahead and leave it up in this
branch anyway.

Actually it looks like someone else has done this!
